# Data-Visualization-with-Python
The repository contains various data visualization plots, plotted using python visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, seaborn and folium.

## Points to remember
1. Plots using folium need to be executed on Jupyter notebook as command line or any IDE is unable to do so.

2. Choropleth maps needs a json file consisting of latitudes and longitudes of regions through which program can identify boundaries of the region. (A file called "world_countries.json" is attached for execution of attached "Choropleth_Map's" code)

3. There is a pdf file called "Outputs of Codes" attached for simplicity.

# Data-Visualization-with-Python
The repository contains various data visualization plots, plotted using python visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, seaborn and folium.

## Points to remember
1. Plots using folium need to be executed on Jupyter notebook as command line or any IDE is unable to do so.

2. Choropleth maps needs a json file consisting of latitudes and longitudes of regions through which program can identify boundaries of the region. (A file called "world_countries.json" is attached for execution of attached "Choropleth_Map's" code)

## Additional
1. Datasets used:
   * "Canada.xlsx": Number of immigrants in Canada from different countries of the world from 1980 to 2013.
   
   * "Data_Science_Topics_Survey.csv": Survey conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics, namely: Big Data, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, etc. The participants had three options for each topic: Interested, Somewhat interested, and Not interested.
   
   * "automobile.xlsx": Features affecting price of a car such as engine-type, horsepower, wheel-base, body-style, etc.
